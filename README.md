# Bot Candidate Detection

## Overview

This is a freelance project to find users that have high chance of being a bot in Twitter. It expands a graph from multiple seed nodes based on some criteria.

## What I've done

- Used the Twitter API via the tweepy library to traverse and build a graph of user nodes on Twitter.
- Implemented the BFS search algorithm in a real-world scenario.
- Coded a minimal backup system to optimize API calls in case of failure.
